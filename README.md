# Argon
An open-source Social Network that I'm building because I am bored.

# Invite-only

Argon is an invite-only service and to create an account you will need an invite generated by someone already with an account. This means there wont be spam accounts or bots roaming the platform. Each invite will only be able to be used once and each account can only generate up to 100 invites. Although we may make a feature to add more invites with a fee.

# Privacy

Argon is based on a 'as little as possible' way off collecting data, it means we only collect data that is vital to our platforms functions (Eg. account details) and data you share with us (All data sharing options are in settings and are off by default, although some features may not be as useful as they would be with data collection turned on)

# Advertising

We do not advertise on our platform currently, although we may change this policy in the future we currently think things like Google Adsense and other advertising platforms are not the way open technoligies should monetize their platforms and we do not currently have the resources to impliment them ourselves. Feel free to email Juaneth if you have inquiries for advertising at `euanwalker2008@gmail.com`
