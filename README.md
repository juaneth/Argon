# Argon

### Argon is a privacy focused social network built for people wh o value their privacy but still want connection

We believe that privacy is a basic human right, even on the internet, and companies (Such as Google and Facebook) collect data on your gender, location, what foods you like, whether or not you are in a relationship and a lot more, way too much. We think that's absurd and needs to change. That's why we are trying to make a new standard for the internet to not rely on data collection that violates our human rights to profit.

We will never sell your data, collect your data or do experiments on your data without your consent.

### Invite Only

To keep out platform fresh and not full of scammers and unwanted people we have an invite-only account system, we generate new accounts every month and users can use our Discord Bot to generate an invite and create new accounts. Then each account can create 25 invites to invite their friends and instantly you have a connection! Now you are on the network and can follow, like and view content.

### Our policies

We think that freedom is the best way to run our platform, that's why the only content that is prohibited on our platform is things like CSAM and content involving users under the age of 13. We think that protecting minors is a priority

### Our appeal system

We think that being heard is the best thing for a platform and our users are our biggest priority. We have appeal forms available in app and on our website to fill out and submit via the website or app and we will review it as soon as possible.
