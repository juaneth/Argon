# Argon
An open-source Social Network that I'm building because I am bored.

# Invite-only

Argon is an invite-only service and to create an account you will need an invite generated by someone already with an account. This means there will be limited amount of spam accounts. Every invite will be able to use only once and each account can generate up to 100 invites.

# Privacy

Argon is based on a 'as little as possible' way off collecting data, it means we only collect data that is vital to our platforms functions (Eg. account details) and data you share with us (Data collection is off by default)
